# Cat run
Cat run is a modified version of the off-line Google game Dino Run. Hit space bar to jump over the cacti. If you hit one the game is over. See how long you can go!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 or newer installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder "dino_run". Start the program by running the following command.```

py dino_run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the __main__.py file inside the dino_run folder and click the "run" icon.
